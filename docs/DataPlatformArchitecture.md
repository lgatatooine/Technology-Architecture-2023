## Notable data platform architecture today

This document captures a collection of the architecture of data platforms and infrastructure that I have built or learned. 
* Comprehensive data infrastructure 
* Data Lake reference architecture
* Data Lakehouse reference architecture

### Comprehensive Data Infrastrucure
A reference data infrastructure provides the complex capabilities for demanding enterprises to analyze data, enable data insight, and drive data-powered products.

### Data Lake Architecture 
A data lake is a centralized repository to store all structured, semi-structured, unstructured data at scale, and run analytics - dashboards, visualization , machine learning for better decisions.

### Data Lakehouse Architecture 
A data lakehouse is an open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.
